A web-based implementation of the classic dice game **Kniffel** (also known as Yahtzee). Built with plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, featuring a clean user interface inspired by Google's Material Design 3 principles. Roll & Score is an independent game project. The use of the term "Kniffel" within this game to describe the dice combination of five of a kind is purely descriptive, referencing a well-known game mechanic, and does not imply any affiliation with or endorsement by the trademark owner or the original Kniffel/ Yahtzee game.

**Enjoy the classic fun right in your browser!**
